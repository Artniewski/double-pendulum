# Decription
This Simulator presents the behavior of the double pendulum by drawing a chaotic trajectory of its movement.

## UI functionalites
-allowing to start/stop the simulation, 

-switch the color of a trace, 

-clear the drawing pane, 

-change variables that significantly affect the movement of the pendulums: 
           rod's lengths, starting angles, ball's masses, and gravitation.
